Subv
====

Subv redesigns V2EX.com.

It's currently designed/developed as an extension to Google Chrome, maybe later I will add UserScript option.

Use
---
Either [download](https://github.com/gDD/subv/zipball/master) & extract zip file *--OR--* clone the repo:

    git clone git://github.com/gdd/subv.git

Then:

`Google Chrome` &rarr; `Settings` &rarr; `Extensions` &rarr; `Check "Developer mode"` &rarr; `Load unpacked extension...`

And you're done, click the icon besides the wrench icon to start Subv.
